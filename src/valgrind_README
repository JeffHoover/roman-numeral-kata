/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libcofi_rpi.so is itself preloaded. So just edit /etc/ld.so.preload on the raspberry, and comment out the line, which should give you the memcmp from glibc instead â€“ nos Nov 19 '13 at 9:41 

to the problem:
disInstr(arm): unhandled instruction: 0xF1010200
                 cond=15(0xF) 27:20=16(0x10) 4:4=0 3:0=0(0x0)
==1774== valgrind: Unrecognised instruction at address 0x4843588.
==1774==    at 0x4843588: ??? (in /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libcofi_rpi.so)
==1774== Your program just tried to execute an instruction that Valgrind
==1774== did not recognise.  There are two possible reasons for this.
==1774== 1. Your program has a bug and erroneously jumped to a non-code
==1774==    location.  If you are running Memcheck and you just saw a
==1774==    warning about a bad jump, it's probably your program's fault.
==1774== 2. The instruction is legitimate but Valgrind doesn't handle it,
==1774==    i.e. it's Valgrind's fault.  If you think this is the case or
==1774==    you are not sure, please let us know and we'll try to fix it.
==1774== Either way, Valgrind will now raise a SIGILL signal which will
==1774== probably kill your program.
==1774== 
==1774== Process terminating with default action of signal 4 (SIGILL)
